# AlphaTraj

AlphaTraj is software designed for analyzing pocket dynamics. 

## Features

Compared to other pocket dynamics analysis software, AlphaTraj has the following features:

1. Divides protein pockets into several sub-pockets (implemented through modified [AlphaSpace2.0](https://github.com/RedesignScience/AlphaSpace2/tree/master) code).
2. Analyzes various dynamic properties of sub-pockets, such as lifetime, fluctuation of pocket volume, average nonpolarizability of the pocket, etc.
3. Examines relationships between sub-pockets, such as coexistence rate and correlation.
4. Implements a scoring function tailored for sub-pockets to characterize their quality.
5. Develops a scoring function for the entire pocket to automatically find the optimal conformations suitable for inhibitor design.
